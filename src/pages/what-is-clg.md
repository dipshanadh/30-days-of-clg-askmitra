# Connect, Learn & Grow

100 days\* of self guided learning. The starting point of your journey to make progress.

## What is CLG ?

100 days of self-guided learning is an initiative by ITSNP ORG to help tech enthusiasts connect and learn new skills daily for 100 days for at least an hour a day while connecting and creating projects together with future tech innovators. The main goal of CLG is to make peer-inspiration more efficient, We believe everyone can guide, and inspire another for good, The learning can be any new skills like coding, personality development, designing, etc., or even enhancing the existing skills you have. The sole goal here is to learn and to form the habit of learning while making your commitment public to make it more consistent. This learning pattern will help you in three main aspects: Consistency, Peer-Inspiration, and Development.

## Code of Conduct

-   Every day, we will learn something new and share it with our Facebook community.
-   During the learning phase, incase of the arrival of the problem we will not hesitate to to ask the problems in askmitra.com.
-   We should be willing to help and grow together as a team.
-   We vow to be consistent, to inspire and motivate others, and to keep the development cycle continuing.

Note : If an individual takes more than three days off without good reason, s/he will be removed from the CLG program.
