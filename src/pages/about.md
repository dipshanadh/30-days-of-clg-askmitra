# About me

Hi, I am Dipshan Adhikari. I am currently studying in class 9 and learning MERN stack.
I have decided to start 30 Days of CLG Askmitra to deep dive into JavaScript and gain an understanding of scope, callbacks, higher-order functions, closure, asynchronous and object-oriented JavaScript!

I really love JavaScript and it was my first programming language. It is so versatile, it can be used to build both the frontend and backend of a website.
I can write code in JavaScript, but I don't know what happens under the hood. I don't know about event loop or execution context or anything like that. So, during this thirty days will learn about these things and understand what actually is happening.

If youâ€™re interested start here: https://clg.askmitra.com

Thank you.
